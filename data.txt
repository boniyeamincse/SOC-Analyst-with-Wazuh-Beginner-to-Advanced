What is SOC ?
=============

=> SOC stands for Security Operations Center.
=> It is a centralized team and facility that monitors, detects, prevents, and responds to cybersecurity incidents.
=> The main goal of SOC is to protect organizational IT systems, networks, applications, and data from cyber threats.
=> SOC operates 24/7 to ensure continuous security monitoring and quick incident response.

=> It combines People (security analysts), Processes (incident handling), and Technology (SIEM, IDS/IPS, Firewalls, EDR).

=> Types of SOC:
   - In-house SOC
   - Managed SOC (MSSP)
   - Hybrid SOC


========================
Security Operations Basics
========================

=> Security Operations (SecOps) refers to the processes and services that ensure an organizationâ€™s information systems are protected from cyber threats.

=> It involves monitoring, detecting, analyzing, and responding to security incidents.

=> Security Operations combines people, processes, and technology to maintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad) of data.

=> Core functions of Security Operations:
   - Threat Detection
   - Incident Response
   - Vulnerability Management
   - Log Analysis & Monitoring
   - Threat Intelligence
   - Compliance & Reporting

=> Tools commonly used:
   - SIEM (Security Information & Event Management)
   - IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems)
   - Firewalls & EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response)
   - Threat Intelligence Platforms

=> Security Operations is usually handled in a SOC (Security Operations Center) with dedicated security teams.

=> Benefits:
   - Continuous 24/7 monitoring
   - Early detection of threats
   - Faster incident response
   - Reduced risk of data breaches
   - Compliance with security regulations

=> Challenges:
   - Alert fatigue due to high volume of logs
   - Shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals
   - Rapidly evolving cyber-attack techniques



===================================
Role of SIEM in SOC Operations
===================================

=> SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management.

=> It is a software solution that collects, normalizes, and analyzes security logs and events from multiple sources across the organization.

=> In SOC operations, SIEM acts as the central nervous system for monitoring and detecting threats.

=> Key roles of SIEM in SOC:
   - Log Collection: Aggregates logs from servers, firewalls, applications, and endpoints.
   - Log Correlation: Connects related events to detect suspicious activities.
   - Real-Time Monitoring: Provides alerts for anomalies and potential cyberattacks.
   - Incident Detection: Identifies threats like malware, phishing, brute force, insider threats.
   - Incident Response Support: Supplies detailed forensic data for investigations.
   - Compliance Reporting: Helps organizations meet regulations (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS, HIPAA).
   - Dashboards & Visualization: Gives SOC analysts a clear view of network security status.

=> Benefits of using SIEM in SOC:
   - Faster detection of security incidents
   - Centralized monitoring across the IT environment
   - Reduced false positives with correlation rules
   - Improves efficiency of SOC analysts
   - Ensures regulatory compliance

=> Without SIEM, SOC operations would struggle to handle large volumes of logs and detect complex attacks effectively.

================================

What is Threat Hunting?

=> Threat Hunting is the proactive process of searching for hidden threats or malicious activities in an organizationâ€™s network and systems.
=> It goes beyond automated alerts, assuming attackers may already be present but undetected.
=> The main goal of Threat Hunting is to identify, analyze, and mitigate threats before they cause damage.
=> Threat Hunting uses data from logs, endpoints, network traffic, and threat intelligence to uncover suspicious behavior.

=> Key Components of Threat Hunting:

	Hypothesis-Based Hunting: Formulate assumptions about possible attacks.
	Data Collection & Analysis: Gather logs and network data for investigation.
	Detection Tools: SIEM, EDR/XDR, network analyzers, threat intel platforms.
	Investigation & Response: Confirm threats and remediate.
	Feedback & Improvement: Update rules, document findings, and strengthen defenses.

=> Types / Methodologies of Threat Hunting:

	Indicator of Compromise (IoC) Hunting â€“ Searching for known malicious signatures.
	Behavioral Analysis Hunting â€“ Detecting unusual or abnormal patterns.
	Analytics-Driven Hunting â€“ Using machine learning and statistical models to find hidden threats.

=> Benefits of Threat Hunting:

	Early detection of advanced attacks.
	Reduces dwell time of attackers.
	Improves overall security posture.
	Enhances threat intelligence and response capabilities.
